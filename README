Maintenance Note
================

As of 2017-06-07 I will no longer work on this installer. I will still
accept Pull Request, but will not test them as thoroughly as
I did previously.



Installation scripts for PSOPT3 [1]
===================================

PSOPT4 [9] comes with it's own Ubuntu 14.04 installer and is not supported
by these scripts.

Currently supported:
- Debian Jessie [2] natively
- Ubuntu 12.04 [3] natively
- Windows 64 Bit [4] with MinGW/MSYS [5] and TDM-GCC [6]

The three installation scripts for the three different operating systems are:
- debian-jessie-psopt-installer.sh
- ubuntu-12-04-psopt-installer.sh
- windows-mingw-64bit-psopt-installer.sh

Last successful tests: October 2015


Installation on Debian
======================

As a prerequisite, the user must be in the groups sudo and staff.

Usage:
In a shell on Debian Jessie do the following:
# ./debian-jessie-psopt-installer.sh


If you do not have downloaded the script yet, do:
# wget https://raw.github.com/Sauermann/psopt-installer/master/debian-jessie-psopt-installer.sh
# chmod a+x debian-jessie-psopt-installer.sh
# ./debian-jessie-psopt-installer.sh

In both cases follow the instructions (enter password for sudo when asked)


Installation on Ububtu
======================

Usage:
In a shell on Ububtu do the following:
# ./ubuntu-12-04-psopt-installer.sh

If you do not have downloaded the script yet, do:
# wget https://raw.github.com/Sauermann/psopt-installer/master/ubuntu-12-04-psopt-installer.sh
# chmod a+x ubuntu-12-04-psopt-installer.sh
# ./ubuntu-12-04-psopt-installer.sh


Installation on Windows 64 Bit
==============================

This installation relies completely on Open-source-software, no
compiler from Microsoft is needed. 32 Bit Installations are not
supported.

OpenBLAS [7] is used as replacement of the Blas Reference
Implementation.

PSOPT will be installed in the directory where the script is executed.

You may uninstall it by deleting the directory it was installed into.

MSYS
----

Get the MinGW/MSYS Installation tool mingw-get-setup.exe from [5].

Install it in the directory $MinGWInstallDir
of your choice (should not have whitespaces) with these packages:
- msys-base (bin)
- msys-wget (bin)
- msys-unzip (bin)
- mingw-developer-tooklitm (bin)
- msys-console (bin) optional

Optionally in order to get a better console, you might want to use
Console 2.00 or these articles might be helpful:

http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.mingw.msys/3930

TDM-GCC
-------

A 64 bit version of the GCC compiler suite is needed.  Download
tdm-gcc-webdl.exe (On-demand installer) from [6].  Follow the
installation instructions and install it in the directory
$InstallationPathOfMinGW64 of your choice (must be different from
$MinGWInstallDir)

->Create ->select "MinGW-w64/TDM64 (32-bit and 64-bit)"

Select the following components to install (GCC v5.1 is the intended version):
- gcc -> core
- gcc -> c++
- gcc -> fortran
- gcc -> openmp
- binutils
- mingw64-runtime
- mingw32-make: deselect
- gdb: optional
- Start Menu items: optional
- Add to PATH: deselect

In the directory $MinGWInstallDir/msys/1.0/etc/ copy fstab.sample to
fstab and change in this file the lines
---
c:/mingw		/mingw
c:/ActiveState/perl	/perl
---
to
---
$InstallationPathOfMinGW64		/mingw
#c:/ActiveState/perl	/perl
---

Gnuplot
-------

Usage of Gnuplot is recommended.

Get the current version (V 5.0.0) from [8] and install it.  Be sure to
include the gnuplot executable into the path - the Gnuplot installer
has an option for this.

Installation
------------

During the installation process several software packages are
downloaded and compiled so be aware that it will take some time. On
test computers it took about 60-90 minutes and uses roughly 1.5 GB of
empty HardDisk space.


Start a msys shell (can be found in $MinGWInstallDir\msys\1.0\msys.bat)
user@computer:~$ cd installation_dir
user@computer:~/installation_dir$ wget -O psopt-installer.zip --no-check-certificate https://github.com/Sauermann/psopt-installer/archive/master.zip
user@computer:~/installation_dir$ unzip psopt-installer.zip
user@computer:~/installation_dir$ cp -r psopt-installer-master/patches .
user@computer:~/installation_dir$ cp -r psopt-installer-master/scripts .
user@computer:~/installation_dir$ ./psopt-installer-master/windows-mingw-64bit-psopt-installer.sh
user@computer:~/installation_dir$ rm -rf patches scripts

Usage
-----

In the directory 'installation_dir' there will be an example-project
'obstacle' from the PSOPT-examples dir. The accompanying Makefile
should help you get started to create your own project.


Known issues
============

On Ubuntu the display of gnuplot charts does not happen automatically.
