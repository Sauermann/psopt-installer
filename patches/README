psopt-gnuplot-windows.patch
===========================

This patch is intended for the Windows version and applies the
following changes to the sourcecode of PSOPT 3.02

- Adjust the Gnuplot-parameters to support newer versions of Gnuplot
  than 4.2.6 [1]
- Remove the '-persist' option to the Gnuplot call. The effect is that
  now Gnuplot windows do not stay open

To enable simultaneous display of the plots, I recommed to save all
plots to files and insert a line

   system("explorer.exe $FILENAME_OF_OUTPUTFILE");

after every plot statemet. (replace $FILENAME_OF_OUTPUTFILE by the
actual filename) - after the installation, the file
$INSTALL_DIR/obstacle/obstacle.cxx contains an example of this usage.
